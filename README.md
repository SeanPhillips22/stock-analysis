## Introduction

This is the public code repository for [StockAnalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/). We want to build the world's best free investing website.

## About the project

The site is running on React/NextJS and is written in Javascript and Typescript. It's styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Key goals

-  Be the fastest finance website on the internet.
-  Have the best user experience of all the investing sites.
-  Be super easy to use and understand. Things should "just work" and feel intuitive to use.
-  The data and info should always be up-to-date and accurate.

You can easily download the code and run the site on your own computer by cloning the repository and running "npm install" and "npm run dev".

**Here are the steps to do it:**

1. First, make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (they're all free)
2. Create a folder on your desktop called "StockAnalysis"
3. Open Visual Studio Code. Click "File" and "Open Folder" -- then find the folder you created and click "Select Folder"
4. Hit CMD+J or CTRL+J to open the terminal in VS Code
5. Write this exact command and hit enter: `git clone https://github.com/stockanalysisdev/stock-analysis.git .` (make sure to include the period at the end)
6. Write this command and hit enter: `npm install`
7. Write this command and hit enter: `npm run dev`
8. You should now be able to open the site in your web browser with this URL: `http://localhost:3001`

Congrats! You now have the site running locally on your own computer, with the site's code ready to edit from Visual Studio Code.
