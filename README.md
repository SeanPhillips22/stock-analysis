## Introduction

This is the public code repository for [StockAnalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/). We want to build the world's best free investing website.

## About the project

The site is running on React/NextJS and is written in Javascript and Typescript. It's styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Key goals

-  Be the fastest finance website on the internet.
-  Have the best user experience of all the investing sites.
-  Be super easy to use and understand. Things should "just work" and feel intuitive to use.
-  The data and info should always be up-to-date and accurate.
