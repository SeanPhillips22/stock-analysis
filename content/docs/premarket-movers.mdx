Premarket trading hours are between [4:00 am and 9:30 am](/stock-market-hours/).

Knowing which stocks are gaining or losing the most during pre-market trading can be valuable.

Our premarket mover pages are designed to help you instantly see exactly which stocks are making the biggest percentage moves before the market opens.

The [premarket gainers](/markets/premarket/gainers/) page shows the stocks with the highest percentage increase, while the [premarket losers](/markets/premarket/losers/) page shows those with the greatest percentage decrease.

These pages update every five minutes between 4:15 am and 9:30 am on trading days

## Not all stocks are shown

In order to improve the quality of the list, we filter away some low-quality penny stocks and over-the-counter stocks.

Here's which stocks are shown on these pages:

-  **Exchanges:** US-listed stocks trading on the NASDAQ, NYSE or NYSE American.
-  **Stock Price:** Price over $1 and previous day close over $1.
-  **Market Cap:** Minimum market cap is $1 million.

## How to change which stocks are shown

If you want to change which stocks are shown based on your own criteria, then you can do so by clicking the three vertical dots above the table and then "Open In Screener."

<div className="my-6 rounded border border-gray-200 shadow">
	<img src="/img/docs/premarket-movers-open-in-screener.png" alt="Open in Screener" />
</div>

This will open the currently shown stocks in the [stock screener](/screener/stock/).

From there, you can filter the stocks based on over 100 different indicators.

For example, you can decide to only show stocks in the S&P500, or stocks with a market cap over $1 billion, or only stocks with a PE ratio below 20.

## How to change the table data

You can change the columns shown in the table by clicking the "Columns" button and selecting the columns you want to see.

<div className="my-6 rounded border border-gray-200 shadow">
	<img src="/img/docs/movers-change-columns.png" alt="Change data columns" />
</div>

For example, you can choose to show the company's revenue, PE ratio or EPS.

The data columns you selected will be remembered in your web browser, so if you visit the page again you will see the same layout again.

<!-- If you want to reset the data columns, click "Options" -> "Reset Table Defaults". -->
